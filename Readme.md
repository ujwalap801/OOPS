# what is OOP?
OOP(object oriented programming) is a programming pardadigm based on the concept of 'objects'

A paradigm can also be termed as a method to solve a problem or perform a task. A programming paradigm is an approach to solving problems using some programming language. It is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach.

# What are the principles of OOPs?
1)Inheritance
2)Encapsulation
3)Polymorphism
4)Abstraction

## Is java object oriented or object based programming?

Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, not just object-based.

# Object-Oriented means that Java supports all key principles of OOP: 
encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. It uses objects to represent data and methods to operate on the data, providing a structured way to model real-world entities.

Object-Based languages, like JavaScript (in its early forms), may support the concept of objects but lack full OOP features like inheritance or polymorphism.

Since Java supports all OOP principles, it is classified as a fully object-oriented language.



# Java is not 100% object-oriented. While Java is primarily an object-oriented programming language, there are certain features that prevent it from being completely object-oriented:

# Primitive Data Types:
 Java includes primitive data types such as int, char, boolean, float, etc., which are not objects. These types are used for performance reasons to avoid the overhead of objects.

# Static Methods and Variables:
 Static methods and variables belong to a class rather than an instance of the class, meaning they are accessible without creating an object. This contradicts the pure object-oriented principle, where everything should be an object.

In contrast, fully object-oriented languages (like Smalltalk) treat everything, including primitive data types, as objects.
