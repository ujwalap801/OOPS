# By using public, varaibles and methods can be access wihtin the class and outside of class of within package and outside of the package


# The private access modifier restricts access to the class, method, or variable only within the defining class. We won't keep private for a class


# If no access modifier is specified, it is considered "default" or "package-private." This allows access only within classes in the same package.


# The protected access modifier allows access to the class, method, or variable from the same package and subclasses (even if they are in different packages).We won't keep protectedfor a class


Public: Accessible from anywhere.

Private: Accessible only within the same class, promoting encapsulation.

Protected: Accessible within the same package and by subclasses, allowing for inheritance.

Default: Accessible only within the same package, useful for package-level encapsulation.
